## 2025-05-15 - Hardcoded JWT Secret Fallback
**Vulnerability:** Use of a hardcoded default string as a fallback for JWT secret in `src/lib/auth.ts`.
**Learning:** Default fallbacks in security code can lead to insecure deployments if environment variables are missing.
**Prevention:** Always fail securely by throwing an error or returning null when critical security configurations are missing, instead of providing a "default" that might be known or predictable.
